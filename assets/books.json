A reluctant partner in this perilous quest is Bilbo Baggins, a comfort-loving unambitious hobbit, who surprises even himself by his resourcefulness and skill as a burglar.\r\n\r\nEncounters with trolls, goblins, dwarves, elves and giant spiders, conversations with the dragon, Smaug, and a rather unwilling presence at the Battle of Five Armies are just some of the adventures that befall Bilbo.\r\n\r\nBilbo Baggins has taken his place among the ranks of the immortals of childrenâ€™s fiction. Written by Professor Tolkien for his own children, The Hobbit met with instant critical acclaim when published.\r\nSource: https://www.harpercollins.co.uk/9780007322602/the-hobbit/"},"physical_format":"Epub","last_modified":{"type":"/type/datetime","value":"2019-03-06T18:26:56.281441"},"key":"/books/OL26757374M","publish_places":["London, England"],"classifications":{},"created":{"type":"/type/datetime","value":"2019-03-06T18:22:06.306781"},"identifiers":{"google":["U799AY3yfqcC"]},"isbn_13":["9780007322602"],"isbn_10":["0007322607"],"publish_date":"2009 03","copyright_date":"1995","works":[{"key":"/works/OL262758W"}],"cover":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/OLID/OL26757374M-M.jpg"},"preview":"full"}
